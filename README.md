<h1>Chicago Data Portal Project</h1>

<h2>Description:</h2>

This project explores the spatial relationship between affordable housing and public school placement in Chicago, a city known for its rich diversity and entrenched socioeconomic divides. We sought to answer the question: What is the relationship between the placement of affordable housing and public schools in Chicago's neighborhoods?

Using datasets from the Chicago Data Portal—including school locations, affordable housing unit counts, and neighborhood boundaries—we built a series of interactive and static visualizations to uncover patterns, outliers, and inequities in urban infrastructure.

<h2>Tools & Technologies:</h2>
